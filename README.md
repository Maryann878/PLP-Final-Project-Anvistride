- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** (v9 or higher) or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anvistride.git
   cd anvistride
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install client dependencies
   cd client
   npm install
   
   # Install server dependencies
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
   ```env
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   
   # MongoDB
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/anvistride
   # OR for MongoDB Atlas:
   # MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/anvistride
   
   # JWT Secret (use a strong random string)
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_minimum_32_characters
   
   # Client URL (for CORS)
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory (optional):
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   
   If using local MongoDB:
   ```bash
   # macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew services start mongodb-community
   
   # Linux
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   
   # Windows
   # Start MongoDB service from Services panel
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   
   From the root directory:
   ```bash
   # Development mode (runs both client and server)
   npm run dev
   
   # Or run separately:
   # Terminal 1 - Server
   cd server
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Client
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - API Health Check: http://localhost:5000/api/health
